I am a fifth year PhD candidate at University of Pennsylvania, supervised by [Professor Hao Huang]([https://www.med.upenn.edu/huanglab/]). I was an undergraduate student in Rice University.


More about me
======

My research interests mainly lie in integrable probability and Kardar–Parisi–Zhang (KPZ) universality, with a particular focus on interacting particle systems, directed polymer models, six-vertex models and their stationary measures.

So far, my appeared works are about stationary measures for the open asymmetric simple exclusion process and for integrable polymer models and six-vertex models on a strip. See my [PUBLICATIONS LIST](https://ZongruiYang1.github.io/publications/).

For the talks I gave, see my [TALKS LIST](https://ZongruiYang1.github.io/talks/).
