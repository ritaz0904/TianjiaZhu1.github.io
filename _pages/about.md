I am a fifth year PhD candidate at University of Pennsylvania, supervised by [Professor Hao Huang]([https://www.med.upenn.edu/huanglab/]). I was an undergraduate student in Rice University.


More about me
======

My research interests mainly lie in diffusion MRI based brain microstructure modelling using both analytical and machine learning approaches. 

See my [PUBLICATIONS LIST](https://ritaz0904.github.io/publications/).

For the talks I gave, see my [TALKS LIST](https://ritaz0904.github.io/talks/).
